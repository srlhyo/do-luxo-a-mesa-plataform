# Website Master Prompt - Do Luxo a Mesa

You are designing a premium website for a boutique events brand called "Do Luxo a Mesa".

## Brand

Tone: editorial, calm, sophisticated, confident, not aggressive or cheap.

Manifesto:
"The luxury is not imposed. It is felt."

## Target audience
People who host dinners, birthdays, baptisms, celebrations and want their home to look beautiful, elegant and memorable.

They value:
- good taste
- simplicity
- visual impact
- zero stress

## Services
- Finger food buffet packages:
  - Essence (420 EUR, minimum 10 days notice)

  - Premium (890 EUR, minimum 21 days notice)
- Decorated tables
- Event rental (Aluga Eventos)
- Bubble Deluxe (50 to 80 EUR)

## Visual style
- White, black and soft gold
- Editorial layout with lots of white space
- Elegant serif headlines
- Clean sans-serif body text
- Big photography and subtle video loops
- No bright colors, no cheap gradients

## Homepage structure
The homepage should contain:
1. Hero section with video or large image, manifesto text and “Request a quote” button
2. Value proposition (short, elegant text)
3. Packages (Essence, Supreme, Premium)
4. Visual gallery
5. How it works (3 simple steps)
6. Extras (Bubble Deluxe, themed tables, rentals)
7. Values or testimonials
8. Final call to action

## Pages

## What you should generate
- A premium homepage layout
- Section by section copy
- Component structure (hero, packages, gallery, etc.)
- Two design variations (one more minimal, one slightly more warm)

The result must look like a luxury boutique brand, not a generic catering website.
